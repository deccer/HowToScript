# HowToScript

Just me trying out yet another way to write an engine from scratch. This time in C++23. Trying to keep everything
in [Main.cpp](src/Main.cpp) and then abstract parts out into separate units or class when needed/necessary.

I will be using OpenGL 4.6. Perhaps when I found a form or state I am happy with I might make it flexible enough
to handle Vulkan too, let's see.

Various people help or have helped me in the process. Be it funny comments, actual advise or ideas for the future.

Thank you in alphabetical order :)
